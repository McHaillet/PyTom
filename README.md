# PytomGUI

PyTom is a toolbox developed for interpreting cryo electron tomography data. All steps from reconstruction, localization, alignment and classification are covered with standard and improved methods.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

PyTomGUI is designed to run on linux systems, but can also be installed on MacOSX.It requires the following software package to be installed:

```
- python (>= 3.7 )
- openmpi 
- fftw3
- gcc (version 5-7) 
- numpy
- boost
- lxml, libxml2, libxstl. 
- swig (>= 3.0.12)
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph
- motioncor2 ( >=1.2.1)
- imod (>=4.10.25)
- mrcfile
```

### Installing

To install PyTomGUI please clone the most recent version by executing the following command 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FridoF/PyTomPrivate.git pytom
```

After a succesful clone enter the new directory and go to pytomc
```
cd PyTomPrivate/pytomc
```

Here you will find an installation script name compile.py. Please run this script with python3. 
```
python3.7 compile.py --pythonVersion 3.7 --target all 
```

If certain dependencies are not found, chances are there you either have not installed them, or that the installation paths to the dependencies are not found automatically. 

It is possible to add installation paths manually by adding them after a respective flag (include dirs after --includeDir, lib dirs after --libDir and exe dirs after --exeDir). More than one path can be added per flag, where each path should be separated by a space. Note that the order of the paths can make a difference.

```
python3.7 compile.py --pythonVersion 3.7 --target all --exeDir [path_to_your_exe_dir1] [path_to_your_exe_dir2] --libDir [path_to_your_lib_dir1] [path_to_your_lib_dir2] --includeDir [path_to_your_exclude_dir1] [path_to_your_exclude_dir2] 
```

To locate missing dependencies try:

```
locate Python.h
```

This results in something similar to:
```
/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.2_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/include/python3.7m/Python.h
/usr/local/Cellar/python@2/2.7.15/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/Python.h
```

Now update the includeDir flag to:

```
python3.7 compile.py --pythonVersion 3.7 --target all --includeDir /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.2_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/include/python3.7m/
```
